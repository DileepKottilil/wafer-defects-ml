**Left column:** raw SWIR input and predicted output (labels shown under each).  
**Right column:** brightness-enhanced versions for human visibility.  
**Note:** SWIR captures are inherently low-brightness; some scratches are only visible via the modelâ€™s attention (e.g., Grad-CAM) and not to the naked eye.
